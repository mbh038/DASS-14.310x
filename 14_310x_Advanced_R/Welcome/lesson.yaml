  Output: Welcome to the 14.310x Advanced R course! This short interactive course is designed
    to provide you with knowledge that you will find useful when working with R during this course
    (and beyond!). Note that while that none of the information presented here is necessary to
    complete the assignments for 14.310x, this course is highly recommended, particularly for those
    who plan to continue working with R following 14.310x. Are you ready to get started?
    (If yes, hit the Enter key)

  Output: Great! Let's get to it. This course will utilize the interactive Swirl environment
    again, which means that you'll navigate the interface in RStudio the same way you did
    in the Intro to R course!

  Output: The course is broken down into 17 modules, excluding this Welcome one.
    Each of these modules is about 15-20 min long, and will cover a specific set of topics. You can find the list 
    of topics and commands within each module on the 14.310x edx page.

  Output: To navigate your way out of a module, if you are at the R prompt (there is a > arrow at the beginning of the line), type "info()" in the command prompt
    to get a list of navigation options. Otherwise, you can return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing the Esc key. 
    Does that make sense?

  Output: One last thing-- you will likely need to install some new helpful packages in order to
        run this course. The packages will help you later if you continue to use R and are mostly related
        to graphics. When prompted in the command line to install new packages, please say Yes, or you will
        be unable to complete this course! Have fun!
